**Project Description**
The Driver Drowsiness Detection (DDD) system is a real-time safety application designed to monitor and alert drivers showing signs of fatigue. Using computer vision techniques with Python (OpenCV, dlib), the system analyzes facial landmarks to detect eye closure and yawning. If drowsiness is detected, a signal is sent to an Arduino board which triggers a buzzer, LED, and updates an LCD display to alert the driver. This project aims to reduce road accidents by providing a proactive solution for driver fatigue detection
